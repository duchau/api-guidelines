# Pattern Name

Microsoft Graph API Design Pattern



Modeling state associated to a collection that may include all instances, an included subset, an excluded subset, no instances, or any combinations of the above.

## Context

A common pattern is to apply a policy or state to a collection of objects. With this, there also comes the question of how to model cases where we want to apply to 'all' or 'none' as well without having to special case these values within the collection set or introducing cross property dependencies. Likewise we'd like to model it in a way where it is easy to understand and interpret usage from just looking at the schema.

A simple example is where you have some policy you need to be able to apply to users in an organization. You may want to support default **None**, enablement for **All** or enablement for **Select** users where you only grant it to a handful of users.

## Problem
--------

Existing patterns for this either have special-cased 'strings' or have tightly coupled dependencies between two independent properties. Neither are intuitive, require reading documentation and cannot be inferred from the schema or within client libraries.

## Solution
--------

Have an abstract base class that all 'variants' of the subset are then derived types from the base subset. You can find general subtyping guidance [here](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/op-graphPatterns/graph/Modelling%20with%20Subtypes%20Pattern.md).

The abstract base class should also hold an enum for all possible variants. The purpose of including this is to allow for easier ways to do query and filter operations on variants like 'all' and 'none' without relying on isof functions.

Base Type
```xml
    <ComplexType Name="membership" IsAbstract="true">
      <Property Name="membershipKind" Type="graph.membershipKind"/>
    </ComplexType>

    <Enum Name="membershipKind">
      <Member Name="all"/>
      <Member Name="enumerated"/>
      <Member Name="none"/>
      <Member Name="unknownFutureValue"/>
    </Enum>
```

Derived Types
```xml
    <ComplexType Name="noMembership" BaseType="graph.membership"/>

    <ComplexType Name="allMembership" BaseType="graph.membership"/>

    <ComplexType Name="enumeratedMembership" BaseType = "graph.membership">
      <Property Name="members" Type="Collection(Edm.String)"/>
    </ComplexType>

    <ComplexType Name="excludedMembership" BaseType = "graph.membership">
      <Property Name="members" Type="Collection(Edm.String)"/>
    </ComplexType>
```

## Issues and Considerations
-------------------------

Given we are using overarching subtype model, subtyping model limitations apply here as well - see [subtyping documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/op-graphPatterns/graph/Modelling%20with%20Subtypes%20Pattern.md) for more details.

## When to Use this Pattern
------------------------

This pattern is to be used when supporting two or more collection states of the following where at least one of the states is a subset variant.
- All targets
- No targets
- Subset of targets to be included
- Subset of targets to be excluded.

If you only **ever** need to support two states - All or None - without usage of any subsets, it would be better to use a Boolean to toggle on and off.

## Example
-------

GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/identity/conditionalAccess/policies/

_Note: unrelated properties on entities omitted for easier readability_

```json
{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#conditionalAccessPolicy",
    "values": [
        {
            "id": "66d36273-fe4c-d478-dc22-e0179d856ce7",
            "conditions": {
                "users": {
                    "includeGuestsOrExternalUsers": {
                        "externalTenants": {
                            "@odata.type":"microsoft.graph.conditionalAccessAllExternalTenants",
                            "membershipKind": "all"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "id": "99d212f4-d94e-cde1-8e3c-208d78238277",
            "conditions": {
                "users": {
                    "includeGuestsOrExternalUsers": {
                        "externalTenants": {
                            "@odata.type":"microsoft.graph.conditionalAccessEnumeratedExternalTenants",
                            "membershipKind": "enumerated",
                            "members": ["bd005e2a-876d-4bf0-92a1-ae9ff4276d54"]
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
